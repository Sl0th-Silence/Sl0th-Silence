## **Quick About**  

**Hello everyone!**

I’m a software developer from **Kingston, Ontario**, currently in my second year of the **Computer Programming and Analysis** program at **St. Lawrence College**.  

After spending five years exploring **Python** and **SQL**, I decided it was time to focus and pursue a formal education in software development.

## **Projects**  

### **Housing Market Site for Kingston**  

This is a project I feel close to, as I live in Kingston and wanted to build something that provides accurate local housing data.  

### **What I learned throughout this Project**

#### **Web Scraping**  
Built a **Python web scraper** using the `requests` library to pull HTML pages from a local real estate site.  
The scraper iterates through each page, extracts key information, and stores it in a **MongoDB** collection.  

#### **API's**  
Developed an **Express.js API** to serve the data.  
It connects to the MongoDB database and exposes the information through a simple JSON endpoint (currently one route).  

#### **Frontend**  
Created a **ReactJS frontend** to fetch, parse, and display the data from the API.  

Through this project, I’ve gained a deep understanding of **full-stack JavaScript development** and learned how different tools and technologies integrate to build a cohesive application.
