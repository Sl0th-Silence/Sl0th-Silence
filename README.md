## **Quick About**  

**Hello everyone!** üëã  

I‚Äôm a software developer from Kingston, Ontario, currently in my second year of the **Computer Programming and Analysis** program at **St. Lawrence College**.  

After spending five years exploring **Python** and **SQL**, I decided it was time to focus and pursue a formal education in software development.

## **Projects**  

### üè† **Housing Market Site for Kingston**  

This is a project I feel close to, as I live in Kingston and wanted to build something that provides accurate local housing data.  

#### **Web Scraper**  
I started by building a **Python web scraper** using the `requests` library to pull HTML pages from a local real estate site.  
The scraper iterates through each page, extracts key information, and stores it in a **MongoDB collection**.  

#### **API**  
Next, I developed an **Express.js API** to serve the data.  
It connects to the MongoDB database and exposes the information through a simple JSON endpoint (for now, a single route).  

#### **Frontend**  
Finally, I built a **ReactJS frontend** to fetch, parse, and display the data from the API.  

Through this project, I‚Äôve gained a deep understanding of **full-stack JavaScript development** and learned how different tools and technologies can integrate to create a cohesive application.
