## Quick About
*Hello everyone!*

I am a software developer from Kingston Ontario, currently in my 2nd year of Computer Programming and Analysis at St. Lawerence College. 
After spending 5 years playing around with Python and SQL, I decided it was time to focus up and go back to school.

## Projects

##Housing Market Site for Kingston
This is a project I feel close to as I live in this town and wanted some close accurate results.

*WEB SCRAPER*
I started with a web scraper made in Python using the request library to pull the html page from a local site. 
I iterated through each page, pulled information, saved and uploaded it to a MongoDB collection. 

*API*
After the scraper, I made an Express API in Javascript and pulled the database in to be sent out to my front end. I only made one route (for now) and sent te information as a JSON file.

*FRONTEND*
I use ReactJS to grab the JSON data, parse it and upload it to my site. 

Over this project, I have learned so much about full stack development in Javascript.
Working on a multi-page project has been challenging but I have learned tons about how different programs and softwares can work together.
